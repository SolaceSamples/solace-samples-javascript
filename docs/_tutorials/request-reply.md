This tutorial outlines both roles in the request-response message exchange pattern. It will show you how to act as the client by creating a request, sending it and waiting for the response. It will also show you how to act as the server by receiving incoming requests, creating a reply and sending it back to the client. It builds on the basic concepts introduced in [publish/subscribe tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/publish-subscribe).

## Assumptions

This tutorial assumes the following:

*   You are familiar with Solace [core concepts]({{ site.docs-core-concepts }}){:target="_top"}.
*   You have access to a running Solace message router with the following configuration:
*   Enabled message VPN
*   Enabled client username

One simple way to get access to a Solace message router is to start a Solace VMR load [as outlined here]({{ site.docs-vmr-setup }}){:target="_top"}. By default the Solace VMR will run with the “default” message VPN configured and ready for messaging. Going forward, this tutorial assumes that you are using the Solace VMR. If you are using a different Solace message router configuration, adapt the instructions to match your configuration.

## Goals

The goal of this tutorial is to understand the following:

*   On the requestor side:
1.  How to create a request
2.  How to receive a response
3.  How to use the Solace API to correlate the request and response

*   On the replier side:
1.  How to detect a request expecting a reply
2.  How to generate a reply message

## Overview

Request-reply messaging is supported by the Solace message router for all delivery modes. For direct messaging, the Solace APIs provide the `Requestor` object for convenience. This object makes it easy to send a request and wait for the reply message. It is a convenience object that makes use of the API provided “inbox” topic that is automatically created for each Solace client and automatically correlates requests with replies using the message correlation ID. (See Message Correlation below for more details). On the reply side another convenience method enables applications to easily send replies for specific requests. Direct messaging request reply is the delivery mode that is illustrated in this sample.

### Message Correlation

For request-reply messaging to be successful it must be possible for the requestor to correlate the request with the subsequent reply. Solace messages support two fields that are needed to enable request-reply correlation. The reply-to field can be used by the requestor to indicate a Solace Topic where the reply should be sent. A natural choice for this is often the unique `P2PINBOX_IN_USE` topic which is an auto-generated unique topic per client which is accessible as a session property. The second requirement is to be able to detect the reply message from the stream of incoming messages. This is accomplished using the `correlation-id` field. This field will transit the Solace messaging system unmodified. Repliers can include the same `correlation-id` in a reply message to allow the requestor to detect the corresponding reply. The figure below outlines this exchange.

For direct messages however, this is simplified through the use of the `Requestor` object as shown in this sample.

## Obtaining the Solace API

This tutorial depends on you having the Solace Systems Web Messaging API for JavaScript downloaded and available. The Solace Systems Web Messaging API for JavaScript distribution package can be [downloaded here]({{ site.links-downloads }}){:target="_top"}. The Web Messaging API for JavaScript is distributed as a zip file containing the required JavaScript files, API documentation, and examples. The instructions in this tutorial assume you have downloaded the Web Messaging API for JavaScript library and unpacked it to a known location.

## Loading Solace Systems Web Messaging API for JavaScript

To load the Solace Systems Web Messaging API for JavaScript on your HTML page simply include the `lib/solclient.js` file from the distribution.

~~~HTML
<head>
    <script src="lib/solclient.js"></script>
</head>
~~~

Use the debug version of the API in `lib/solclient-debug.js` file instead, if you’re planning to see console log messages and/or debug it.

~~~HTML
<head>
    <script src="lib/solclient-debug.js"></script>
</head>
~~~

If the debug version is used, it is necessary to initialize `solace.SolclientFactory` with required level of logging like so:

~~~javascript
var factoryProps = new solace.SolclientFactoryProperties();
factoryProps.logLevel = solace.LogLevel.INFO;
solace.SolclientFactory.init(factoryProps);
~~~

## Connecting to the Solace message router

In order to send or receive messages, an application must connect a Solace session. The Solace session is the basis for all client communication with the Solace message router.

The `solace.SolclientFactory` is used to create Solace session from a set of `SessionProperties`.

Notice the two mandatory callbacks in the `createSession()` call. The first one (of `solace.MessageRxCBInfo` type) is the message event callback. It receives messages. The second one (of `solace.SessionEventCBInfo` type) is the session event callback. It receives events indicating the Solace session connected, disconnected, ready for sending requests or subscribing to a request topic or encountered an error.

The created session connects to the Solace message router with the `session.connect()` call.

This tutorial’s sample code comes as two separated applications: one (with the “requestor” object) send requests to a specific topic and the other (with the “replier” object) subscribes to requests on that topic, receives the requests and replies on them.

The following is an example of session creating and connecting to the Solace message router for the requestor. The replier’s code will be exactly the same.

~~~javascript
var sessionProperties = new solace.SessionProperties();
sessionProperties.url = 'ws://' + host;
sessionProperties.vpnName = 'default';
sessionProperties.userName = 'tutorial';
requestor.session = solace.SolclientFactory.createSession(
    sessionProperties,
    new solace.MessageRxCBInfo(function (session, message) {
        requestor.messageEventCb(session, message);
    }, requestor),
    new solace.SessionEventCBInfo(function (session, event) {
        requestor.sessionEventCb(session, event);
    }, requestor)
);
try {
    requestor.session.connect();
} catch (error) {
    requestor.log(error.toString());
}
~~~

At this point your browser is connected as a client to the Solace message router. You can use SolAdmin to view this client connection and related details.

## Session Events

The Solace Systems Web Messaging API for JavaScript communicates changes in status and results of connect and subscription calls through the session callback of type `solace.SessionEventCBInfo`.

It is necessary to wire your application logic to events from this callback. The most important events are:

*   `SessionEventCode.UP_NOTICE`: success connecting session to the Solace message router
*   `SessionEventCode.DISCONNECTED`: session was disconnected from the Solace message router
*   `SessionEventCode.SUBSCRIPTION_OK`: subscription to a topic was successfully created on the Solace message router

This is how this callback can be implemented in the sample requestor:

~~~javascript
requestor.sessionEventCb = function (session, event) {
    requestor.log(event.toString());
    if (event.sessionEventCode === solace.SessionEventCode.UP_NOTICE) {
        requestor.log('=== Successfully connected and ready to send requests. ===');
    } else if (event.sessionEventCode === solace.SessionEventCode.CONNECTING) {
        requestor.log('Connecting...');
    } else if (event.sessionEventCode === solace.SessionEventCode.DISCONNECTED) {
        requestor.log('Disconnected.');
        if (requestor.session !== null) {
            requestor.session.dispose();
            requestor.session = null;
        }
    }
};
~~~

On the replier side we also might want to implement reaction to subscription error and to subscription added or removed:

~~~javascript
replier.sessionEventCb = function (session, event) {
    replier.log(event.toString());
    if (event.sessionEventCode === solace.SessionEventCode.UP_NOTICE) {
        replier.log('=== Successfully connected and ready to subscribe to request topic. ===');
    } else if (event.sessionEventCode === solace.SessionEventCode.CONNECTING) {
        replier.log('Connecting...');
        replier.subscribed = false;
    } else if (event.sessionEventCode === solace.SessionEventCode.DISCONNECTED) {
        replier.log('Disconnected.');
        replier.subscribed = false;
        if (replier.session !== null) {
            replier.session.dispose();
            replier.session = null;
        }
    } else if (event.sessionEventCode === solace.SessionEventCode.SUBSCRIPTION_ERROR) {
        replier.log('Cannot subscribe to topic: ' + event.correlationKey);
    } else if (event.sessionEventCode === solace.SessionEventCode.SUBSCRIPTION_OK) {
        if (replier.subscribed) {
            replier.subscribed = false;
            replier.log('Successfully unsubscribed from request topic: ' + event.correlationKey);
        } else {
            replier.subscribed = true;
            replier.log('Successfully subscribed to request topic: ' + event.correlationKey);
            replier.log('=== Ready to receive requests. ===');
        }
    }
};
~~~

See the [Web Messaging API Concepts: “Handling session events”]({{ site.docs-session-events }}){:target="_top"} documentation for the full list of session event codes.

## Making a request

First let’s look at the requestor. This is the application that will send the initial request message and wait for the reply.  

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Request-Reply_diagram-2.png)

The requestor must create a message and the topic to send the message to:

~~~javascript
var requestText = 'Sample Request';
var request = solace.SolclientFactory.createMessage();
requestor.log('Sending request "' + requestText + '" to topic "' + requestor.topicName + '"...');
request.setDestination(solace.SolclientFactory.createTopic(requestor.topicName));
request.setSdtContainer(solace.SDTField.create(solace.SDTFieldType.STRING, requestText));
request.setDeliveryMode(solace.MessageDeliveryModeType.DIRECT);
~~~

Now the request can be sent. Notice callbacks `replyReceivedCb` and `requestFailedCb`. These are functions that will be called when a reply message is received (`replyReceivedCb`) or sending of the request is failed (`requestFailedCb`).

~~~javascript
try {
    requestor.session.sendRequest(
        request,
        5000, // 5 seconds timeout for this operation
        function (session, message) {
            requestor.replyReceivedCb(session, message);
        },
        function (session, event) {
            requestor.requestFailedCb(session, event);
        },
        null // not providing correlation object
    );
} catch (error) {
    requestor.log(error.toString());
}
~~~

## Replying to a request

Now it is time to receive the request and generate an appropriate reply.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Request-Reply_diagram-3.png)

Just as with previous tutorials, you still need to connect a session and subscribe to the topics that requests are sent on (the request topic). The following is an example of such reply.

~~~javascript
replier.reply = function (message) {
    replier.log('Received message: "' + message.getSdtContainer().getValue() + '", replying...');
    if (replier.session !== null) {
        var reply = solace.SolclientFactory.createMessage();
        var replyText = message. message.getSdtContainer().getValue() + " - Sample Reply";
        reply.setSdtContainer(solace.SDTField.create(solace.SDTFieldType.STRING, replyText));
        replier.session.sendReply(message, reply);
        replier.log('Replied.');
    } else {
        replier.log('Cannot reply: not connected to Solace message router.');
    }
};
~~~

The `replier.reply` is the function that is called from the replier message event callback that is passed to the `solace.SolclientFactory.createSession` call:

~~~javascript
replier.messageEventCb = function (session, message) {
    try {
        replier.reply(message);
    } catch (error) {
        replier.log(error.toString());
    }
};
~~~

## Receiving the Reply Message

All that’s left is to receive and process the reply message as it is received at the requestor or report a failure to send the request:

~~~javascript
requestor.replyReceivedCb = function (session, message) {
    requestor.log('Received reply: "' + message.getSdtContainer().getValue() + '"');
};

requestor.requestFailedCb = function (session, event) {
    requestor.log('Request failure: ' + event.toString());
};
~~~

## Summarizing

Combining the example source code shown above results in the following source code files:

*   [BasicRequestor.html]({{ site.repository }}/blob/master/src/BasicRequestor/BasicRequestor.html)
*   [BasicRequestor.js]({{ site.repository }}/blob/master/src/BasicRequestor/BasicRequestor.js)
*   [BasicReplier.html]({{ site.repository }}/blob/master/src/BasicReplier/BasicReplier.html)
*   [BasicReplier.js]({{ site.repository }}/blob/master/src/BasicReplier/BasicReplier.js)

### Running samples

The samples consist of two separate requestor and replier browser applications, each comes as a pair: one HTML file and one JavaScript file that is loaded by the HTML file.

JavaScript functions get connected to HTML buttons when the browser window loads (`window.onload`) as follows.

In the requestor (_BasicRequestor.html_):

~~~javascript
document.getElementById("connect").addEventListener("click", requestor.connect);
document.getElementById("disconnect").addEventListener("click", requestor.disconnect);
document.getElementById("request").addEventListener("click", requestor.request);
~~~

In the replier (_BasicReplier.html_):

~~~javascript
document.getElementById("connect").addEventListener("click", replier.connect);
document.getElementById("disconnect").addEventListener("click", replier.disconnect);
document.getElementById("subscribe").addEventListener("click", replier.subscribe);
document.getElementById("unsubscribe").addEventListener("click", replier.unsubscribe);
~~~

### Sample Output

First open _BasicReplier/BasicReplier.html_ page in the browser and connect to a Solace message router by specifying the router’s URL and clicking “Connect” button.

The following is a screenshot of the tutorial’s _BasicReplier/BasicReplier.html_ web page with the JavaScript debug console open in the Firefox browser. It captures the page after it was loaded and the “Connect” button was clicked.

Then subscribe to the subscription topic by clicking the “Subscribe” button.

The following is a screenshot of the tutorial’s _BasicReplier/BasicReplier.html_ web page with the JavaScript debug console open in the Firefox browser. It captures the page after it was loaded and the “Connect” button was clicked and then the “Subscribe” button was clicked.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/javascript-request-reply_2.png)

Now, open _BasicRequestor/BasicRequestor.html_ page in the browser and connect to the same Solace message router as the _BasicReplier_ specifying the router’s URL and clicking “Connect” button.

The following is a screenshot of the tutorial’s _BasicRequestor/BasicRequestor.html_ web page with the JavaScript debug console open in the Firefox browser. It captures the page after it was loaded and the “Connect” button was clicked.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/javascript-request-reply_3.png)

Send request by clicking the “Send Request” button on the _BasicRequestor/BasicRequestor.html_ page.

The following screenshots of the tutorial’s _BasicRequestor/BasicRequestor.html_ and _BasicReplier/BasicReplier.html_ web pages with the JavaScript debug console open in the Firefox browser. It captures the page after a request was sent and replied.

This is the requestor is sending a request and receiving a reply (_BasicRequestor/BasicRequestor.html)_:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/javascript-request-reply_4.png)

This is the replier is receiving the request and replying to it (_BasicReplier/BasicReplier.html)_:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/javascript-request-reply_5.png)

With that you now know how to successfully implement request-reply message exchange pattern using Direct messages.
