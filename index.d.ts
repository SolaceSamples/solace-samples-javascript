  /**
   * <b>This class is not exposed for construction by API users.</b>
   * A Queue Browser is created by calling {@link solace.Session#createQueueBrowser}.
   *
   * A Queue Browser allows client applications to look at messages spooled on Endpoints
   * without removing them. Messages are browsed from oldest to newest.
   * After being browsed, messages are still available for consumption over normal flows.
   * However, it is possible to selectively remove messages from the persistent store of an Endpoint.
   * In this case, these removed messages will no longer be available for consumption.
   * Note: If browsing a queue with an active consumer, no guarantee is made that the browser will
   * receive all messages published to the queue. The consumer can receive and acknowledge messages
   * before they are delivered to the browser.
   *
   * One typical application is to use Browsers to allow message bus administrators to remove “stuck”
   * Guaranteed messages from an Endpoint without having to modify or disrupt existing applications.
   * A message can get stuck if:
   *
   *  1) It has been received by an application, but for some reason, that application has failed to
   *     acknowledge it.
   *  2) All active message selectors have failed to match this particular message and therefore the
   *     message bus has not delivered it to any client yet. The current release only supports
   *     browsing Endpoints of type Queue.
   *
   * Note that the delivery restrictions imposed by the queue’s Access type
   * (exclusive or non-exclusive), do not apply when browsing messages with a Browser.
   *
   * Browser characteristics and behavior are defined by {@link solace.QueueBrowserProperties}.
   * The properties can also be supplied as a simple key-value {Object}. The queue descriptor,
   * {@link solace.QueueBrowserProperties#queueDescriptor} must be specified to identify the
   * Guaranteed Message Queue on the Solace Message Router.
   *
   * The Browser is an EventEmitter, and will emit events to which the application may choose to
   * subscribe, such as the connection to the Solace Message Router going up or down.
   *
   * If a registered listener for an emitted event throws an exception, this is caught and emitted as
   * an 'error'.
